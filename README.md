<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a Microverse Bootcamp Final Capstone project named eBARTENDER. Consideration is given to making it a responsive, mobile-first app with a Ruby on Rails RESTful API at the back-end and ReactJS for the front-end.
When a user navigates to the app, they are presented with option of either logging in as a
previous user or signing up as a new user. Once done the user is presented with a list of
curated Cocktails from different part of the world. A user can add a Cocktail
as part of favourite cocktail list and from there they can get the recipe in case
they want to prepare such cocktail at home. If the user is bored with the
current favourite cocktail list, they can remove it from their list of
favourites and move on to select new ones. The app is tested with RSpec and uses PostgreSQL as the main
database.
